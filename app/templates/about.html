      Welcome to Flower Finder, a web application built by computer science students Alanna DeMuro, 
      Isaiah Fujii Bresnihan, Elizabeth Riffle, and NaNa Mathis. These students were motivated
      to build this application for their Computer Science 121: Software Development course
      project. The group of four wanted to share the knowledge of flowers with anyone who might be 
      interested, whether one is an avid nature or garden-lover, or out for a casual stroll in the park. 
      Flower Finder offers a way for anyone to identify 102 different flowers just by uploading an image. 
      We hope we are able to share our love of nature with you through this app!
